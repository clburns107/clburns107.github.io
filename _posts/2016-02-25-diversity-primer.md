<h3>Feelings on the Diversity Primer</h3>

As a woman I was concerned about the diversity in the tech industry before I decided to switch careers to programming. After being accepted to Omaha Code School I sent Sumeet an email asking for some sort of ratio of men to women in the class.  I was very surprised and happy to hear that it's about 50/50. 

I still have a lot of worry about the lack of diversity in the field as a whole. Is the tech industry of the 2000's basically repeating the organizational structure of the advertising industries from 1950's? Are companies not sufficiently diversified because they choose not to be or because there's a lack of resources? And how will I be able to tell the difference before I commit myself to a job with one? And even of all of those questions are answered how do I fit seamlessly into, what will most likely be,a predominantly male occupied industry without major personal sacrifice?

I do take comfort in knowing that there are groups and organizations based out of Omaha specifically for women in this field.  I plan to utilize them to the fullest extent when my schedule allows it. I believe these women would be an invaluable resource with great insite.
