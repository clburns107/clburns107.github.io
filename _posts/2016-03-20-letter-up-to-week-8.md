<h3>Feelings on OCS up to week 8</h3>

CSS is a giant pain in the ass. Our assignment this week is to recreate a handful of screenshots that Sumeet gave us using CSS. I've spent the past 20 minutes trying to figure out why his font looks ever so slightly thicker than mine but increasing the thickness of mine by 1 pixel seems to overdo it. Can you code in 1/2 pixels? You know those Do-It-Yourself articles that say stuff like "Make Your Own Wedding Cake for One Tenth the Cost!" and the article has some half-assed walk through on how to hack a professional job with 10 years of experience and talent and then by the end you've got a tower of cakes that only look slightly tilted if youre standing at a certain angle with blobs of pink poop all over it because YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE FLOWERS and vines that change from green to blue because you simply ran out of the green icing? Thats what this looks like.
