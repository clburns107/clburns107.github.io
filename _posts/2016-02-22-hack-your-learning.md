title: How I've Learned to Hack My Learning
---

I've realized that I work better in a comfortable environment, so I work better from home than I do from school. However the resources of Sumeet and Alex during the day are far more beneficial than a comfortable environment so I like to stay at school to utilize them for their knowledge.  I wear headphones a lot at school.  I have found an app called Focus. That blocks any apps or websites I have stipulated in case I try to deviate from my productivity time. I use it in hardcore mode so I can't turn it off once I activate it. I can't work with music that has words in it. I can't listen to the tv or other people talking about a non-related subject, so I try to drown out all of those ambient noises as best as I can. 

I've also realized that when I get into the "zone" with my coding it can take an earthquake in Nebraska to tear me away from it. To my detriment I have gone hours without eating because I'm too stubborn and focused on solving a particular problem.  I have also realized that if I step away and eat something no matter where I am at in the problem usually when I come back I can see exactly where the code went wrong. So I save myself hours of frustration from operating on low energy by taking 45 minutes to just eat something.
