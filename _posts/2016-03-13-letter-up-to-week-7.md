<h3>Feelings on OCS up to week 7</h3>

This week we've been instructed to instruct. That is, we're making instructional videos about how we refactor and implimented a particular feature from our pair projects. 

We have also been introduced to JavaScript and just when I thought I had a good grasp on things all of a sudden im reeling back to week 3. This was a sudden shift for me and I'm still trying to figure out what exactly the DOM is. So far I just think it's the God of front-end development and no one truly understands God so no one truly understands the DOM.
