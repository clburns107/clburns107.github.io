<h3>Week 5</h3>

This week was not nearly as stressful as last week.  I feel like I struggled for so long last week that the things I learned will be engraved into my brain for the rest of my life.  This week we only built on those concepts rather than introducing new ones so, aside from a few syntax errors in my code, the struggle has not been _nearly_ as real. 

I've found that drawing out references for myself really helps me keep track of where I am in a concept.  I usually draw out what I’m trying to say.  Make sure it makes sense then insert code where I can without a lot of self-doubt. The rest is all of process of elimination. Doing that let's me advance further and faster than I previously had been without stopping.  I’ve also been making myself stop to eat lunch on a daily basis. I’m finding I run into less roadblocks in the afternoons now that I’ve implemented that strategy.  

This week I totally crushed a whole day's worth of assignments (with my personal best timing) got a message from my teacher that I kicked butt, and moved on to adding a class method (which hasn’t been formally introduced to the class yet) to my code, and made it work. 

I rock!
