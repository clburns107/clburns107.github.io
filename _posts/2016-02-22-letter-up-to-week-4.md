<h3>Feelings on OCS up to week 4</h3>

I worry constantly that I'm behind everyone else in the class. It's difficult to just simply know if you're on track without actually knowing how far behind or ahead you area everyone else.  Last Friday the concept of ActiveRecord was introduced and I could not understand it for the life of me, when to use .find_by and when to use .where.  Sumeet sent a message to the class that we would be slowing down on Monday to allow concepts to fully form.  We kept that pace the whole week. I could not be grateful enough and to my surprise the rest of the class was pretty much on that same page as well.  I feel like I *just* mastered the workings of tables and objects and collections of objects this weekend, which is why I am writing this at 7 am on a Monday before class.
