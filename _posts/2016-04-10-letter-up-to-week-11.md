<h3>Feelings on OCS up to week 11</h3>

This week we spent a good majority of time being taking through workings of rails, administrate, and devise. Rails is not all that different from Sinatra. You just have to remember where your routes go... those'll getcha. We built a simple to-do-list application (very similar to the one we built in Sinatra in previous weeks).  The point was not to have a finished product for our resume but to just get used to working with the Framework.  Since I had already spent a fews days working in the back-end on the previous project it didnt take too long for me to catch the hang of it. 

On the job front however we are starting mock interviews this week.  It's awkward and weird and uncomfortable but I supposed that's how interviews normally are.  I can say that I am very impressed and exctatic with Sumeet's dedication to helping us find jobs.  Obviously we'll have to do the leg work but the last job placement program that I experienced was in college and it consisted of a newly graduated student proof reading your resume for typos...aaaaand thats about it. The fact that Alex and Sumeet not only read our resume's and make suggestions/edits but have also compiled a list of resources for job searches, give _numerous_ tips on how to hack the system, and are orchestrating an employer panel for next week is astounding to me.  

And I think that is what is missing from a regular college experience (or at least mine), because thats the point isnt it? I'm trusting that what you teach me is going to get me a good paying job in that exact career field. And if I'm going to spend literally thousand of dollars on an education for that sole purpose why wouldn't I want you to *PROVE* to me that you're not selling me the Emporor's new clothes? I would, of course I would. We all would!
